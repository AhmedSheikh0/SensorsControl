# SensorsControl

This system is used to control 3 different sensors (Temperature sensor, light sensor and Potentiometer) using ADC asynchronous conversion to check the readings of each sensor and return its value.

## Components
  - ATmega32 AVR Microcontroller.
  - LM35 Temperature sensor.
  - LDR Light sensor.
  - Potentiometer.

## Features
This system allows the user to read and display temperature, LDR and Potentiometer values when reaches a certain values.
